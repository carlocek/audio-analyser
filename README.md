# Audio Analysis Tool
This is a small web application developed with Python and Streamlit to upload wav file, apply and visualize the Discrete Fourier Transform definition to extract frequencies and reconstruct the original signal
## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- Libraries listed in requirements.txt
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>

    ```
3. Run the application
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
